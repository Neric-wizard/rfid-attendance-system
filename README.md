## 🧠 System Architecture

```
[RFID Tag] → [Arduino UNO + MFRC522] → [Serial Port] → [Java Desktop App] → [Firebase Firestore]
```

This architecture allows for **instant attendance updates** in the cloud as soon as a student’s RFID tag is scanned by the Arduino hardware.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites
- **Java JDK 17+**
- **Gradle** (or use included wrapper)
- **Arduino IDE** (for microcontroller setup)
- **Firebase Project** with Firestore database

### 2️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Neric-wizard/rfid-attendance-system.git
cd rfid-attendance-system
```

### 3️⃣ Add Firebase Credentials
Place your Firebase key JSON file here:
```
src/main/resources/serviceAccountKey.json
```

### 4️⃣ Run the Desktop App
```bash
./gradlew run
```

### 5️⃣ Connect the Arduino
- Upload the provided Arduino sketch.
- Note your serial port (e.g., `COM4`).
- Ensure your Java app uses the same port in the config.
